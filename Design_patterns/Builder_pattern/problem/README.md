In this example, as we can see that we want to make list or paragraph and to make this object, we know there are certain steps which we are currently following, adding ```<p>``` then adding the content and then adding ```</p>```. Similarly for lists we are following the steps to get the desired result but we don't want this to be the way how user will create a list or a paragraph, we want to provide user the flexibility to utilize our custom made builder so that it can automatically do this stuff.
